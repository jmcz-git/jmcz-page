My blog turns 1yo today!
<!--more-->

Welcome, dear reader, to the first birthday party of my weblog. If you've got the time I would like to regale you with a short synopsis of my life as a developer for the past year.


That first blog post got me into gear, after it had been published I realized something very important. You need stuff to go in a blog.You need content. The only content I had at the time was code I had written for school or an online course. It became very apparent that there is no shortage of this type of easily produced content. I knew what I had to do. I came to the conclusion that I have to go out into the "real world" and find someone that is in need of a piece of software. The logic behind this being that if I kept searching for more courses I would never now what it's like to write production level software.

I knew a couple of web developers at the time so I reached out to see if they'd be willing to offer any pointers. I can't really explain how just how ridiculous the next events were. But they both offered to take time out of their busy lives to mentor a newbie out, this grace will not be forgotten. Having done a few pair programming sessions with bonafide software engineers I was getting ready to start my own project. 


This did not happen, well not immediately. I completed a basic CRUD "app" that would display quotes and sayings followed by their author. It is an application, but only by definition. It still felt like I was completing simulations or trying to give my eyes their very own javascript parser. I wanted more. I wanted to know what production felt like.


So the stars decided to align for me one more time. My programming sensei had a friend reach out to him about a business he was starting up. He found a pretty big niche-market that was still taking orders by hand, his idea included a software tool to help him with order taking. The sensei being a busy man (and very trusting), offered his friend to let me handle the app. I learned a lot about "production" level software projects. This was a Full-Stack project that was thrown on my lap, compared to what I know now, I had no idea what "Full" stack entailed. Initially the back-end was built using Node and a hosted Mongoose DB, trying to figure out the DevOps side became a nightmare. After many failed attempts at wrangling Gitlab's managed Kubernetes CI/CD pipeline the answer became clear, switch to something better, switch to Firebase.

Not long after the back-end was back in order, the first version of the MVP was ready.


Right around that same time, my sensei was notified of a job opening at work. They'd been looking for qualified candidates for long enough that they decided to give me a shot. I had only done one technical interview previously, so I had some semblance of what to expect during the interview. Can you imagine my relief when the the first question was to write a JS snippet to loop through an array and print the running total? Because I could not!


Long story short, I got a call back saying that I had a company laptop assigned and it was ready to be picked up on Monday.


Since, March I've been working with some high caliber engineers. I still can't shake the feeling that all this is a covid induced fever dream. I am learning the ropes from engineers that have many years of enterprise level software development. That is something I never thought I would be able to say truthfully, but it just goes to show how with a little bit of elbow grease and some persistence even the mightiest mountain can be marred.


Thank you for joining me in celebrating this special day!
