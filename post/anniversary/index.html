        <p>My blog turns 1yo today!</p>
<p>Welcome, dear reader, to the first birthday party of my weblog. If you&rsquo;ve got the time I would like to regale you with a short synopsis of my life as a developer for the past year.</p>
<p>That first blog post got me into gear, after it had been published I realized something very important. You need stuff to go in a blog.You need content. The only content I had at the time was code I had written for school or an online course. It became very apparent that there is no shortage of this type of easily produced content. I knew what I had to do. I came to the conclusion that I have to go out into the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; and find someone that is in need of a piece of software. The logic behind this being that if I kept searching for more courses I would never now what it&rsquo;s like to write production level software.</p>
<p>I knew a couple of web developers at the time so I reached out to see if they&rsquo;d be willing to offer any pointers. I can&rsquo;t really explain how just how ridiculous the next events were. But they both offered to take time out of their busy lives to mentor a newbie out, this grace will not be forgotten. Having done a few pair programming sessions with bonafide software engineers I was getting ready to start my own project.</p>
<p>This did not happen, well not immediately. I completed a basic CRUD &ldquo;app&rdquo; that would display quotes and sayings followed by their author. It is an application, but only by definition. It still felt like I was completing simulations or trying to give my eyes their very own javascript parser. I wanted more. I wanted to know what production felt like.</p>
<p>So the stars decided to align for me one more time. My programming sensei had a friend reach out to him about a business he was starting up. He found a pretty big niche-market that was still taking orders by hand, his idea included a software tool to help him with order taking. The sensei being a busy man (and very trusting), offered his friend to let me handle the app. I learned a lot about &ldquo;production&rdquo; level software projects. This was a Full-Stack project that was thrown on my lap, compared to what I know now, I had no idea what &ldquo;Full&rdquo; stack entailed. Initially the back-end was built using Node and a hosted Mongoose DB, trying to figure out the DevOps side became a nightmare. After many failed attempts at wrangling Gitlab&rsquo;s managed Kubernetes CI/CD pipeline the answer became clear, switch to something better, switch to Firebase.</p>
<p>Not long after the back-end was back in order, the first version of the MVP was ready.</p>
<p>Right around that same time, my sensei was notified of a job opening at work. They&rsquo;d been looking for qualified candidates for long enough that they decided to give me a shot. I had only done one technical interview previously, so I had some semblance of what to expect during the interview. Can you imagine my relief when the the first question was to write a JS snippet to loop through an array and print the running total? Because I could not!</p>
<p>Long story short, I got a call back saying that I had a company laptop assigned and it was ready to be picked up on Monday.</p>
<p>Since, March I&rsquo;ve been working with some high caliber engineers. I still can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that all this is a covid induced fever dream. I am learning the ropes from engineers that have many years of enterprise level software development. That is something I never thought I would be able to say truthfully, but it just goes to show how with a little bit of elbow grease and some persistence even the mightiest mountain can be marred.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me in celebrating this special day!</p>
